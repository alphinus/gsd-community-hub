<objective>
Implement four on-chain revenue instructions (init_revenue_config, record_revenue_event, claim_revenue_share, execute_burn) with comprehensive bankrun tests covering the full revenue lifecycle.

Purpose: The economic core of the platform -- these instructions enforce the 60/20/10/10 split, contribution-weighted claims, and burn traceability on-chain.
Output: 4 instruction files, updated lib.rs/mod.rs, bankrun test suite

Create four instruction files in `programs/gsd-hub/src/instructions/`:

**init_revenue_config.rs** -- Initialize the revenue config singleton PDA:
- Accounts: `revenue_config` (init, payer=admin, space=8+RevenueConfig::INIT_SPACE, seeds=[b"revenue_config"], bump), `admin` (Signer, mut), `system_program`
- Handler args: `treasury_address: Pubkey`, `maintenance_address: Pubkey`, `gsd_mint: Pubkey`, `usdc_mint: Pubkey`, `min_revenue_threshold: u64`
- Set default split: developer_bps=6000, treasury_bps=2000, burn_bps=1000, maintenance_bps=1000
- Validate bps sum to 10000 (return RevenueError::InvalidSplitRatios if not)
- Set admin, bump, addresses, event_count=0, threshold

**record_revenue_event.rs** -- Record a new revenue event with computed splits:
- Accounts: `revenue_config` (mut, seeds=[b"revenue_config"], bump=revenue_config.bump), `revenue_event` (init, payer=authority, space=8+RevenueEvent::INIT_SPACE, seeds=[b"revenue_event", &revenue_config.event_count.to_le_bytes()], bump), `authority` (Signer, mut -- must equal revenue_config.admin), `system_program`
- Handler args: `total_amount: u64`, `token: RevenueToken`, `origin_signature: [u8; 64]`, `total_contribution_score: u64`
- Validate: total_amount >= revenue_config.min_revenue_threshold (RevenueError::BelowMinimumThreshold)
- Validate: authority == revenue_config.admin (RevenueError::UnauthorizedBurnAuthority -- reuse or add dedicated error)
- Compute splits using basis points: `developer_pool = total_amount * developer_bps / 10000`, same for treasury_reserve, burn_amount, maintenance_amount. Handle rounding: assign any remainder (total_amount - sum of 4 parts) to developer_pool.
- Set all fields on revenue_event, status=Recorded, recorded_at=Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp
- Increment revenue_config.event_count

**claim_revenue_share.rs** -- Contributor claims their weighted share:
- Accounts: `revenue_event` (mut, seeds=[b"revenue_event", &revenue_event.event_index.to_le_bytes()], bump=revenue_event.bump), `revenue_claim` (init, payer=claimant, space=8+RevenueClaim::INIT_SPACE, seeds=[b"revenue_claim", claimant.key().as_ref(), revenue_event.key().as_ref()], bump), `developer_profile` (seeds=[b"developer", claimant.key().as_ref()], bump -- read the developer profile to get contribution_score), `claimant` (Signer, mut), `developer_pool_vault` (mut, SystemAccount -- the PDA-controlled vault holding the developer pool; for SOL claims this is a system account), `system_program`
- IMPORTANT: Use `init` (NOT `init_if_needed`) for revenue_claim -- this prevents double-claiming because Anchor's init constraint fails if PDA already exists.
- Validate: revenue_event.status == Recorded or Distributing (not Completed)
- Validate: developer_profile.contribution_score > 0 (RevenueError::NoContributionScore)
- Validate: revenue_event.total_contribution_score > 0 (RevenueError::DivisionByZero)
- Calculate share: `amount = developer_pool * contribution_score / total_contribution_score` (use u128 intermediary to prevent overflow)
- For SOL claims: transfer lamports from developer_pool_vault to claimant via system program or direct lamport manipulation
- NOTE on SOL transfer: The simplest pattern for a PDA-controlled SOL vault is to have the record_revenue_event instruction transfer the developer_pool amount to a dedicated vault PDA. Then claim_revenue_share transfers from that vault using PDA-signed CPI. Alternatively, since all revenue is detected server-side and the on-chain recording is an authority action, the developer_pool SOL can be held in the revenue_event account itself via extra lamports. For v1 simplicity: the `record_revenue_event` doesn't transfer SOL on-chain -- the server-side distributor handles the actual SOL/USDC transfers. The on-chain claim_revenue_share instruction records the claim and the server-side system fulfills the transfer. This decouples on-chain bookkeeping from fund custody (similar to how governance deposits go through the server).
- REVISED APPROACH for v1: `claim_revenue_share` is a bookkeeping instruction that creates the RevenueClaim PDA and updates claimed_amount. The actual SOL/USDC transfer to the claimant is handled by the server-side distributor (which calls the transfer after verifying the claim PDA exists). This is simpler and avoids complex PDA vault custody for v1.
- Set all claim fields: claimant, revenue_event key, bump, contribution_score, total_score, amount, claimed_at
- Update revenue_event.claimed_amount += amount

**execute_burn.rs** -- Record a completed burn on the revenue event:
- Accounts: `revenue_event` (mut, seeds=[b"revenue_event", &revenue_event.event_index.to_le_bytes()], bump=revenue_event.bump), `burn_authority` (Signer -- must match revenue_config.admin), `revenue_config` (seeds=[b"revenue_config"], bump=revenue_config.bump), `gsd_token_account` (mut, token::TokenAccount), `gsd_mint` (mut, token::Mint), `token_program` (Program<Token>)
- Handler args: `gsd_amount: u64`, `burn_tx_signature: [u8; 64]`
- Validate: burn_authority == revenue_config.admin
- Validate: revenue_event.burn_signature is all zeros (RevenueError::BurnAlreadyExecuted)
- Execute SPL token burn via CPI: `anchor_spl::token::burn` with authority=burn_authority, from=gsd_token_account, mint=gsd_mint
- Update revenue_event.burn_signature = burn_tx_signature
- Update revenue_event.gsd_burned = gsd_amount
- If all conditions met (claimed_amount approaches developer_pool, burn recorded), update status to Completed. For v1 simplicity: mark Completed after burn is recorded (distribution tracking can be enhanced later).

**Update instructions/mod.rs**: Add 4 new modules and pub use statements.

**Update lib.rs**: Add 4 new instruction entry points in the `#[program]` block:
- `init_revenue_config(ctx, treasury_address, maintenance_address, gsd_mint, usdc_mint, min_revenue_threshold)`
- `record_revenue_event(ctx, total_amount, token, origin_signature, total_contribution_score)` -- import RevenueToken in lib.rs
- `claim_revenue_share(ctx)`
- `execute_burn(ctx, gsd_amount, burn_tx_signature)`

Import `RevenueToken` (and `RevenueStatus` if needed) alongside existing `QuorumType, VoteChoice` imports in lib.rs.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd programs/gsd-hub && cargo check` -- all 4 instructions compile. Run `anchor build` to generate updated IDL.</verify>
  <done>4 revenue instructions compile, lib.rs has all entry points, IDL generated with new instructions</done>

  <name>Task 2: Write bankrun tests for revenue instructions</name>
  <files>
    programs/gsd-hub/tests/revenue.test.ts
  </files>
  <action>
Create `programs/gsd-hub/tests/revenue.test.ts` following the pattern from `contribution.test.ts` and governance tests:

**Setup**: Use `startAnchor` with extra programs from `tests/fixtures/` (spl_token.so, spl_account_compression.so, spl_noop.so). Create `BankrunProvider` and `Program<GsdHub>`. Load IDL from `target/idl/gsd_hub.json`.

**Test cases** (each test creates an isolated bankrun context):

1. **"initializes revenue config with 60/20/10/10 split"**
   - Call `init_revenue_config` with treasury, maintenance, gsd_mint, usdc_mint addresses, and min_revenue_threshold
   - Fetch the RevenueConfig PDA account
   - Assert: developer_bps=6000, treasury_bps=2000, burn_bps=1000, maintenance_bps=1000
   - Assert: event_count=0, admin matches signer

2. **"records a revenue event with correct split amounts"**
   - Init config first, then call `record_revenue_event` with total_amount=10_000_000_000 (10 SOL), token=Sol, a dummy origin_signature, total_contribution_score=1000
   - Fetch the RevenueEvent PDA
   - Assert: developer_pool = 6_000_000_000, treasury_reserve = 2_000_000_000, burn_amount = 1_000_000_000, maintenance_amount = 1_000_000_000
   - Assert: status = Recorded, total_contribution_score = 1000, claimed_amount = 0
   - Assert: revenue_config.event_count = 1

3. **"rejects revenue below minimum threshold"**
   - Init config with min_revenue_threshold = 100_000_000 (0.1 SOL)
   - Try to record event with total_amount = 50_000_000 (0.05 SOL)
   - Assert: fails with BelowMinimumThreshold error

4. **"contributor claims revenue share proportional to score"**
   - Init config, register a developer (using register_developer), update their contribution score (using update_contribution_score), record a revenue event
   - Call `claim_revenue_share` as the contributor
   - Fetch RevenueClaim PDA
   - Assert: amount = developer_pool * contributor_score / total_score
   - Assert: revenue_event.claimed_amount updated

5. **"prevents double-claiming for same event"**
   - After successful claim from test 4 setup, attempt second claim_revenue_share
   - Assert: fails (PDA already initialized)

6. **"records burn with traceability"**
   - Init config, record event, create a $GSD mint and token account (follow the pattern from governance tests for mint creation), mint some $GSD tokens to burn authority's ATA
   - Call `execute_burn` with gsd_amount and a dummy burn_tx_signature
   - Fetch RevenueEvent PDA
   - Assert: burn_signature matches input, gsd_burned matches input
   - Assert: $GSD token balance reduced by gsd_amount

7. **"prevents double burn on same event"**
   - After recording a burn, attempt second execute_burn
   - Assert: fails with BurnAlreadyExecuted error

Use `BN` from `@coral-xyz/anchor` for u64 args (per existing decision). Use `new Uint8Array(64)` for dummy signatures. For the RevenueToken enum, pass the Anchor-generated enum variant (e.g., `{ sol: {} }`).
