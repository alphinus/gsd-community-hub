<objective>
Implement the on-chain instructions for quadratic voting with sybil resistance, vote delegation, and governance config updates -- the core smart contract logic for Phase 6.

Purpose: This is the on-chain engine that transforms governance from linear to quadratic voting with delegation support. All instructions must be thoroughly tested with bankrun.
Output: Modified cast_vote, 3 new instructions (delegate_vote, revoke_delegation, update_governance_config), and comprehensive bankrun test suites.

**cast_vote.rs** -- Major modification:

1. Add `isqrt` function (Newton's method integer sqrt for u64) as a module-level helper:
```rust
pub fn isqrt(n: u64) -> u64 {
    if n == 0 { return 0; }
    if n == 1 { return 1; }
    let mut x = n;
    let mut y = (x + 1) / 2;
    while y < x {
        x = y;
        y = (x + n / x) / 2;
    }
    x
}
```

2. Add accounts to CastVote struct:
- `pub governance_config: Account<'info, GovernanceConfig>` -- read-only, seeds = [b"governance_config"], bump = governance_config.bump
- Conditionally require gateway_token when quadratic voting is enabled. Use `/// CHECK: Verified by gateway token validation` with `UncheckedAccount` for the gateway token. Since `solana_gateway` crate compatibility with Anchor 0.32.1 is UNKNOWN (research pitfall 2), implement MANUAL gateway token validation instead of using the crate:
  - Pass gateway_token as `Option<UncheckedAccount<'info>>`
  - If quadratic_voting_enabled: require gateway_token is Some, manually validate it exists and is owned by expected gateway program (document the validation logic in comments)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Due to the uncertainty around `solana_gateway` crate compatibility, implement a SIMPLIFIED sybil check for v1: verify the gateway_token account exists, is owned by the Civic gateway program, and is not empty. Log the gateway token address. Full gateway token deserialization can be added in a follow-up if the crate is compatible. This avoids blocking the entire Phase 6 on crate compatibility.
  - Alternative: If `solana_gateway` crate works with `cargo add solana_gateway` (try it first!), use `Gateway::verify_gateway_token_account_info()` directly.

3. Add DelegationRecord check: Before calculating weight, check if voter has an active delegation. Seeds: ["delegation", voter.key()]. If DelegationRecord exists and is_active = true, reject with `GovernanceError::VotingPowerDelegated` (prevents double-counting).

4. Modify weight calculation:
```rust
// Base weight from voter's own deposit
let mut total_tokens: u64 = ctx.accounts.vote_deposit.deposited_amount;

// Add delegated tokens from remaining_accounts
for account_info in ctx.remaining_accounts.iter() {
    let delegation = Account::<DelegationRecord>::try_from(account_info)?;
    require!(delegation.delegate == ctx.accounts.voter.key(), GovernanceError::InvalidDelegation);
    require!(delegation.is_active, GovernanceError::DelegationInactive);
    // Only count delegations effective for current round or earlier
    total_tokens = total_tokens.checked_add(delegation.delegated_amount).ok_or(GovernanceError::Overflow)?;
}

// Apply quadratic or linear formula
let weight = if ctx.accounts.governance_config.quadratic_voting_enabled {
    isqrt(total_tokens)
} else {
    total_tokens
};
```

**delegate_vote.rs** -- Create NEW instruction:
- Accounts: governance_config (read), vote_deposit (read, must have deposited_amount > 0, active_votes == 0), delegation_record (init, seeds ["delegation", delegator.key()]), delegator (signer), delegate (UncheckedAccount -- just stored), system_program
- Handler: Set all DelegationRecord fields. delegated_amount = vote_deposit.deposited_amount. effective_from_round = governance_config.round_count (takes effect next round). delegated_at = Clock::get().unix_timestamp. is_active = true.

**revoke_delegation.rs** -- Create NEW instruction:
- Accounts: delegation_record (mut, seeds ["delegation", delegator.key()], constraint is_active = true), delegator (signer)
- Handler: Set is_active = false. Optionally close account and return rent to delegator (use close = delegator constraint on the account for rent reclaim).
- Actually, don't close -- set is_active = false so delegation can be re-created (PDA will conflict with init if closed and re-inited in same slot). Instead, just set is_active = false and the delegator can create a new delegation later by closing and reiniting. Better approach: close the account so a new delegation can be created. Use `delegation_record.close(delegator.to_account_info())` at end of handler.

**update_governance_config.rs** -- Create NEW instruction:
- Accounts: governance_config (mut, seeds, admin signer constraint), admin (signer)
- Args: quadratic_voting_enabled (bool), civic_gatekeeper_network (Pubkey), decay_half_life_days (u16)
- Handler: Realloc governance_config to new size (168 bytes) if needed. Set the 3 new fields.
- NOTE: Since GovernanceConfig is being extended with 35 new bytes (133 -> 168), the existing init instruction created it at 133 bytes. This instruction must realloc. Use `#[account(mut, realloc = 8 + 168, realloc::payer = admin, realloc::zero = false)]` on governance_config.

**mod.rs** -- Add module declarations and pub use for delegate_vote, revoke_delegation, update_governance_config.

**lib.rs** -- Add 3 new instruction handlers:
- `pub fn delegate_vote(ctx: Context<DelegateVote>) -> Result<()>`
- `pub fn revoke_delegation(ctx: Context<RevokeDelegation>) -> Result<()>`
- `pub fn update_governance_config(ctx: Context<UpdateGovernanceConfig>, quadratic_voting_enabled: bool, civic_gatekeeper_network: Pubkey, decay_half_life_days: u16) -> Result<()>`

Run `anchor build` to verify compilation.

Run `anchor build` -- must compile with no errors.
Verify isqrt function: `grep "pub fn isqrt" programs/gsd-hub/src/instructions/cast_vote.rs`
Verify new instructions exist: `grep "delegate_vote\|revoke_delegation\|update_governance_config" programs/gsd-hub/src/lib.rs`
Verify governance_config realloc: `grep "realloc" programs/gsd-hub/src/instructions/update_governance_config.rs`
  </verify>
  <done>
cast_vote supports quadratic weight (isqrt) with sybil gate and delegation aggregation via remaining_accounts. delegate_vote creates DelegationRecord PDA. revoke_delegation closes DelegationRecord. update_governance_config reallocs and sets quadratic/Civic/decay fields. All compile cleanly.

**quadratic-voting.test.ts** -- Create bankrun test suite:

Test setup: Initialize governance config, create a round, create mint, deposit tokens for voters. Then call update_governance_config to enable quadratic voting (set quadratic_voting_enabled = true, civic_gatekeeper_network to a test pubkey, decay_half_life_days = 180).

Tests (minimum 5):
1. **"linear voting weight when quadratic disabled"** -- With quadratic_voting_enabled=false, cast_vote should use full deposited_amount as weight (regression test)
2. **"quadratic voting weight is sqrt of deposited tokens"** -- Enable quadratic, deposit 10000 tokens, cast_vote should record weight = isqrt(10000) = 100. NOTE: Since sybil gate requires gateway token, this test must either: (a) mock the gateway token account, or (b) test with a simplified sybil check. Recommend creating a test gateway token account with correct owner.
3. **"quadratic voting rejects without gateway token"** -- Enable quadratic, attempt cast_vote without gateway_token account. Should fail with HumanVerificationRequired.
4. **"update_governance_config sets new fields"** -- Call update_governance_config, read back governance_config account, verify all 3 fields set correctly
5. **"update_governance_config rejects non-admin"** -- Non-admin signer should fail

**delegation.test.ts** -- Create bankrun test suite:

Test setup: Same governance + round + mint setup.

Tests (minimum 6):
1. **"delegate voting power to another wallet"** -- delegator deposits tokens, calls delegate_vote, verify DelegationRecord created with correct fields
2. **"delegator cannot vote while delegation active"** -- After delegating, delegator's cast_vote should fail with VotingPowerDelegated
3. **"delegate votes with combined weight"** -- Delegate deposits own tokens + receives delegation. cast_vote passes DelegationRecord as remaining_account. Weight should be isqrt(own_deposit + delegated_amount) when quadratic enabled, or (own_deposit + delegated_amount) when linear.
4. **"revoke delegation"** -- Delegator calls revoke_delegation. DelegationRecord account should be closed. Delegator can now vote directly again.
5. **"cannot delegate with no deposit"** -- Wallet with 0 deposited tokens should fail delegate_vote
6. **"cannot delegate with active votes"** -- Wallet with active_votes > 0 should fail delegate_vote

Use existing test patterns from governance-voting.test.ts: startAnchor, BankrunProvider, SPL token fixtures, createTokenAccount/mintTo helpers.
